				<h1>About this Study</h1>
				
				<p>
					Hello! Thank you for considering this study. Your participation has the potential to make a positive difference in the lives of many.
				</p>
				<p>
					For this study, researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital are asking people with disease XYZ to use their smartphones to report information about themselves that may improve how XYZ is treated.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you participate in this study, we will ask you about your health, activities, medications, and the ways in which XYZ has impacted your daily life.
					This information will be reported anonymously—meaning the researchers won’t know who you are.
				</p>
				<p>
					This study is sponsored by the <i>Computational Health Informatics Program</i> (CHIP) at Boston Children’s Hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					We look forward to your participation!
