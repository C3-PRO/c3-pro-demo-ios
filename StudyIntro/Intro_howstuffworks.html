				<h1>How the Study Works</h1>
				
				<p>
					The Cool Name app will collect information on your health through short surveys that will include questions like:
					<ul>
						<li>Which medication are you currently taking or have you taken in the past?</li>
						<li>During the past seven days, how many hours did you miss from work because of problems associated with XYZ?</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Cool Name app will set occasional reminders to use the app to complete these study tasks.
					You will be reminded about every month for an overall survey and about every week for a quick survey, asking about how well you recently fared.
					You can choose not to have the app provide reminders.
