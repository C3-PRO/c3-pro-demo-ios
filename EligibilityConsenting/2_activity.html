	Once you have given your consent, you can start using the Cool App to:
	<ul>
		<li>Answer survey questions about medications you are currently taking or have taken in the past for your XYZ.</li>
		<li>Answer survey questions about your health and habits.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The Cool app will set occasional reminders to use the app to complete study tasks.
	These will remind you every month to take a survey and every week to take a quick survey about how well you recently fared.
	You can choose not to have the app provide reminders.
